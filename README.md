Snakebit is a simple [snake-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game for the
[BBC micro:bit v2](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/).

Installation should be as simple as running the following command while the micro:bit is connected via USB:

```shell
cargo embed --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

The game should then start running immediately.
